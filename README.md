This project focuses on handwritten letter and character recognition using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy on the given dataset. To enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting, various data augmentation techniques have been applied. 

I did this project in google colab pro and used T4 Gpu and i have written more about it , in the project pdf.
